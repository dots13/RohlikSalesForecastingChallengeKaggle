# Rohlik Sales Forecasting Challenge ðŸŽ¯
This project aims to predict future sales using historical product sales data. The solution includes:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EdA): Insights into data distributions and feature relationships.
- Modeling: CatBoost and LightGBM models are used for forecasting, with Optuna for hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
- Feature Engineering: New time-based features, along with rolling and lag features, were created to capture temporal dependencies.
- Forecasting Approach: A one-step-ahead forecasting method is used for accurate sales predictions.
- Forecasting Strategy: Implemented one-step-ahead forecasting for more accurate predictions.
- Model Tracking: Used MLflow to track models and results for efficient experimentation and monitoring.
